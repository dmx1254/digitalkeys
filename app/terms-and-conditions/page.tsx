                apply to all contracts of the Seller and a contracting partner
                (hereinafter “Customer”) on the sale, delivery and temporary
                provision of digital contents, digital goods and non-digital
                goods (hereinafter collectively also “Goods”). To the extent
                that the Seller also offers services, the Seller shall render
                them exclusively as ancillary service to the aforementioned
                purchase contracts. Deviating, conflicting or complementing
                General Terms & Provisions of the Customer shall become part of
                a contract only if and to the extent that the Seller expressly
                consented to their application. A tacit recognition of General
                Terms & Conditions of the Customer by the Seller by conclusive
                behaviour shall be excluded. Such consent requirement shall
                apply in any case, including, for example, if the Seller
                unconditionally renders services towards the Customer while
                being aware of the Customer’s General Terms & Conditions.
